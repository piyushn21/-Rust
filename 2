Machine learning in Rust has gained traction in recent years due to Rust's performance, safety, and growing ecosystem of libraries and tools. While Rust might not have as many machine learning libraries as languages like Python, it does offer several options for building machine learning models. Here are a few key libraries and tools for machine learning in Rust:

Nn: Nn is a neural network library for Rust that provides building blocks for creating and training neural networks. It offers flexibility in designing custom neural network architectures and supports various activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.

Tangram: Tangram is a machine learning framework specifically designed for deployment in Rust. It allows developers to train models using a high-level interface and then export them for use in production systems. Tangram supports both classification and regression tasks and includes features for monitoring model performance and drift detection.

Leaf: Leaf is a machine learning framework for Rust that aims to provide a simple and efficient interface for building and training models. It includes implementations of various algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, as well as utilities for data preprocessing and evaluation.

rustlearn: Rustlearn is a machine learning library that provides implementations of common algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines. It is designed to be easy to use and efficient, with a focus on performance optimization and parallelization.

Linfa: Linfa is a machine learning framework for Rust that provides a consistent interface for working with different algorithms and data types. It includes implementations of various algorithms, such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction, as well as utilities for data preprocessing and evaluation.

These are just a few examples of machine learning libraries and frameworks available in Rust. As Rust's ecosystem continues to grow, it's likely that more libraries and tools for machine learning will be developed, making it an increasingly viable option for building ML applications.
